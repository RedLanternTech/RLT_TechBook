I am using the Cinnamon Desktop but I wanted the Mint icons and themes.
I just did the legacy themes because they are available in the AUR.  
The default themes in Cinnamon for EndeavourOS (basically Arch Linux for people with lives) are fine, just somewhat bland.

This will probably work in ArcoLinux and Manjaro but I haven't tried.  I basically decided to go with EndeavourOS because its super close to Arch, and really easy to get going (relativity speaking)

One Command To Run

`sudo yay -S mint-themes-legacy mint-y-icons mint-x-icons mint-sounds`

Thats it,
