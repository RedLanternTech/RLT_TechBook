Hacking Ourselves 

sidragon@mac.com @Sidragon1 

It could be that the purpose of your life is only to serve as a warning to others 

Ask more questions.  

Eat fucking healthy or you are going to die.  

Do something before its too late 

Talk with someone.  

Be strong enough to know when you need a break.  

Why do I want to scream and shout?  Ask the questions 

Make a list of the stuff you are dealing with.  what is actually affecting you.  
- face what you have to deal with 
- its the only way you can deal 

As best as we know, you have one life.  

Its all about balance 
- find something you enjoy doing
- put boundaries in place
