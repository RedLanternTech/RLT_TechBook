Jesus was the original hacker.  
- leave a good wake behind you- learn to seek out and give open and honest feeback 
- be cautios to learn the right lessions
- be thankful 
- action cures fear and work 
- tho it costs you all that you own, get understanding 

Trustworthy repuation is important.  

don't say umm, uhh, err, or any other fillers.  You own the room.  Stop, take a breath, and thnk what you want to say.  

You need to learn to manage others perceptions of you  

Teach and lead by example 

Don't personalize your ideas 
- make it about the team, mission, and project 

your boss not exist to hire and fire you and yell at you in between 

SANs 504 

If you can't draw out of the people around you their best, then I don't want you and i don't need you.
