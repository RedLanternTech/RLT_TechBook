- Investigation is not taught often. 

What is an investigation:
- Observation 
- Question 
- Hypothesis 
- Answer 
- Conclusion 

Success should be based on the quality of the analysis, the completeness of the investigation, and if we were able to accomplish the objective, based on the technical and time constraints that were in play.  

Where you able to follow the process.  

Analysis Flow:
- Investigation strategy: Have a plan.  What are you analysing, Who is analyzining, when should you report initial findings.  Organize and document your evidence.  Don't rush in without a plan.  Use a template.  Understand your objectives and have them early.   
- Findings.  Include Time Stamp, Source, Event Description, Context, Code 
- Correlation 
- Timeline 
- Enrichment

- Logs,
