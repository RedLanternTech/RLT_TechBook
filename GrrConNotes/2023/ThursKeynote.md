# Thursday Keynote, Guardians of Reality - Countering Hype in InfoSec

Kevin Johnson - SecureIdeas.

Infosec is a lot like TSA, security theater.  

Vast majority of what owns us is stuff we have known about forever. 

We hype the latest thing and worry about the wrong things.  

be excited about the shit that moves the needle.  

actually understand risk.

Marketing tends to take over. 

We should be customer focused. Give them what helps them, what they need.  Maybe not always what they think they need.

Every automated pen test is just a vuln scan.  

We have to be more customer focused.  

We need to not keep ourselves separate from users/customers.  

OpSec guys fuck up constantly.  

Ask on Automated PenTest - Who validates the results.  
 - still a good idea to run to look for low-hanging fruit. 
 
 Don't become boomer facebook.  
 
 Need to start looking at how we build things, using education and partnering.  
 
 Ignorant is not an insult, it means you don't know.  
 We should be teaching people stuff
 Good InfoSec is a guy that answers questions.  

We have to be known as the group that is helping.  
 - Shutup and listen
 - be a resource that someone can ask 
 - if its really bad, pull someone afterwards.  
 - hear what people are dealing with.  Don't be a used car salesperson.
