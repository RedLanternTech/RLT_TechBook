# My Ransomware Breech Story 

Nate Ruehs - Incident Response Consultant. On twitter at @nate2x4

Started as a malware outbreak alert in AV Console 

hit by ReVILE 

RMM tool was pushing out the ransomware.  Was pending under the Owner of the MSP
 - had popped the Owner's RMM account 

Sometimes AV stopped the attack, systems that didn't have AV didn't stop the attack. 

Called their clients the first night and the next morning
Called Insurance Two days after incident
 - was the most painful thing ever
 - Attorney's were not happy 
 - don't call the clients yet, don't tell everybody until you know what is going on
 
**Don't call it a breech, call it a cyber incident.  Call Insurance and an attorney**

Insurance slowed them down and didn't tell them anything they didn't already know.  
 - they were there to help the msp, not the msp's clients.  won't help the clients 
 
## What they did:
- preserve evidence
- determine if ransom needed to be paid
- began restoration and rebuilding 
- participated in a lot of calls 

they were not prepared, hadn't done a tabletop before. 

Trying to prioritize and keep things difficult is hard to do .  

## Scope of the Incident 
- stolen credentials 
- lokibot stole credentials 
- revil encrypted machines and sold decryptor per machine 
- some machines with av were not protected 
- logs indicated data was not ex-filtrated 
- several hundred machines were impacted 

Credit card information that was stored in google chrome was stolen as well. 

**Check your damn backups**

**have backups that work**

One firm got their data back 3 years later after a decrypter was released.  

Don't call clients until you know the full story 

## Recurring Theme:
- no cyber insurance
- third party backups that don't work 

SOC audits didn't save the day.  Audits do not save a company from being encrypted 

## Common in incidents 
- Long days.  you get more done late at night when everyone is gone 
- Every emotion (fear, sadness, anger, relief)
- The slowdown by insurance, legal, and incident response teams 
- the unexpected 
- make sure to take care of yourself during the incident. 

**The Incident Will End.  You will get though it**
