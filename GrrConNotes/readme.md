# GRRCon Notes.

Thought I would make my GrrCon notes I took available. 

A couple things:
- I didn't proofread them
- I type on the fly
- I did this in Doom Emacs (probably)
- They are all markdown
- Sorry if they are incomplete.  

I would like to thank the organizers of GrrCon, it is a great convention and I hope to attend for many years to come
