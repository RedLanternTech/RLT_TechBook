# Setting up an RTL-SDR in Linux Mint as a Panadapter

These are my notes to make the RTL-SDR work as a panadapter with my Mark V.

1. Run `sudo apt install rtl-sdr`  as you don't have to compile or do anything
2. Reboot the computer and make sure the rtl-sdr is plugged in
3. Run `rtl_test` to verify the sdr is working
4. Install GQRX using the appimage from the main GQRX Web Site
5. Setup the RTL-SDR using the config file
