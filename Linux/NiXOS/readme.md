# The Story so Far.

So I did try out NixOS but I cannot for the life of me see me using it as a daily driver.  

My next cloud server will run it at some point, but as a desktop os, no.

I need to have AppImages work and maybe Snap Packages (yes I know, hate me, don't care).

Eitherway, I did come up with a nice configuration that I'm going to dump here.  Feel free to use it and take ideas from it. 

I hope it helps.  If you get into NixOS, godspeed and good luck.
